# Form validation

Simple React app with form containing fields:

- username
- password
- email

- From contains checkbox toggle that controls visibility of email field.
- Form uses Formik library to enhance post submit validation.
- Submit message is shown, dependent on the results of validation.
- On successfull form submission, a fake API POST request is being sent - this mimics forms ability to throttle invalid
  API requests.
